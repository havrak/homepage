# Homepage

In this repo is primitive static html page, that I use as my homepage in firefox browser.

I tried multiple different methods on how to run it (http server, addon), but none worked well. Currently pressing I have binding in sxhkd for super+t to open html in firefox. That way tridactly will be able to inject its JS and url bar won't be focused by default.
